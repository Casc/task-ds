Notes:

- Although I've been learning R at "Elements of Statistics" course, I'm using Python because I don't think I have enough time to dive into R manuals (however it won'y be a problem for me to re-learn this language).
- I'm using Anaconda environment, recommended by Google Udacity Data Science course, with Python 3. Python was chosen because it is the programming language that I know best.
- Libraries and tools: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and jupyter notebook (as a great way to easily create .md or .pdf files with commented code).
