**Conclusions**

What have I learned from the exploration of given dataset (for more insight on my process, please check process_md directory => my_process.md)

- Most of the data comes from Turkey, Spain, Poland, Colombia and Italy (91%)
- Most of the students come from Turkey (over 6k), Spain, Colombia and Poland
- For each unit, number of students who are taking it decreases. 
- Students are less likely to do review units than normal units, however it appears that they like the video podcasts
- Less than 20% of the students goes beyond Review 3 - it is the only situation, when there are more students doing review than the next unit.
- There is a significant number (over 10%) of students, who skip unit 1. However, these students have smaller drop-out rate in later units. And they are even less likely to do any reviews. Also more of them is doing the last unit (12), than Video Podcasts
- Only a small number of students do all units, while most of them do only one to three units, 13 units (probably 9 units, 3 reviews and podcasts, it is worth further investigation in the future), or 11 units.
- Without teachers supervision, most of the students do only one or two units.
- Students from Turkey have the best average units / per students (then Italy, spain, Mexico, and Poland)
- From top 15 countries (by student numbers) Italy has the lowest "teachers_rate" (0.71), which is still converted to a very huge average units per student score.
- Unit completion drops gradually until the unit 10, then the decrease becomes even more significant.
- Good average score is harder to achieve at the beginning, then students with top score rises, but after unit 6, % of students with problems increases.

**Bussiness Analysis** 
- Maybe the course is too long (by three units). If teachers are unable to complete the course (which is possible, looking at provided data), there is no point in having such a long course, if majrity of the students don't go past unit 9.
- Probably it would be a good idea to ask teachers from Turkey, how are they motivating their students to do the course, and also learn more about how they are helping them.
- It seems to be good idea to have more Video Podcasts, as these are quite popular, maybe Video Podcasts with Reviews?
- It would be also a good idea to ask students from Italy how they are so motivated, even when they have no teachers supervision.
